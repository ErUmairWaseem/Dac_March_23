Algorithm->
----------

1. Start
2. take class marksheet
3. take input from user (marks of five subject)
4. store marks in a,b,c,d & e variables
5. find sum
	i.e. a+b+c+d+e
6. store sum in s variable
7. print sum
8. find average
    i.e. avg = sum/total subject
9. store avg in avg varible
10. print avg
11. find percentage
    i.e. (sum/500)*100
12. store percentage in p variable
13. print percentage
14. end
