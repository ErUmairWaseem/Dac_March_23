//. Write a java program to find LCM of TWO given numbers. 

Algorithm

1. start
2. take a class
3. write main method
4. take two inputs from user and initialize them in a and b
5. initialize hcf=1
6. take while loop check condition(a != b)
7. if a>b
8. a = a-b
9. else 
10. b = b-a
11. hcf=aorb
12. lcm = (a*b)/hcf
13. print lcm
14. end
