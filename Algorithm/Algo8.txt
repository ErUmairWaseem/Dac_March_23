//Write a Java Program to print the number of digits of a Given Number. 

Algorithm->
----------

1. start
2. take a class
3. write a main method
2. Take number as a input from a user and initialized it in "num" variable
3. take a variable count, initialized it by 0
4. using while loop (when num is not equal to 0)
5. extract the digit one by one by using % operator and store it other variable m
6. increase the value of count by one
7. num = num / 10  // truncate last digit
8. print value of count
9. end
