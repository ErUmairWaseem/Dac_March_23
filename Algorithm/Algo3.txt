// Write a Algorithm to find the Factorial of a given number using recursion.

Algorithm->
----------

1. Start
2. write a class factorial
3. write main method
4. Take input from user and store in varible num.
5. Write another method factorial which return some value and take some value x from main method 
6. check if x == 0
7. It will return x to main method
8. else
9. It return x*(x-1) computation to the main
10. main methode takes value from factorial method
11. print the result in main.
12. ends
