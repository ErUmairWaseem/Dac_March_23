//Write a Java Program to find the sum of the digits of a given number.

Algorithm->
----------

1. Start
2. take a class
3. write main method
4. Take a digit from user as a input.
3. initilize sum by 0
5. take a while loop (digit != 0)
6. exract the digit using modulus operator and initialize in variable m
7. sum = sum +m
8. num = num /10
9. print the value of sum 
10. end
