//Swapping of two numbers without using third variable

Algorithem->
-----------

1. Start
2. make a class
3. write main method
4. initialize two numbers
   a=4, b=8
   Apply conditions
5. adding a and b and store it in a.
   i.e. -> 4+8=12  //a=a+b
6. subtracting b from a and store it in b.
      b = 12-8=4  //b=a-b
7. sutracting b from a and store it in a.
	  a = 12-4=8  //a=a-b
8. print the result
9. end
